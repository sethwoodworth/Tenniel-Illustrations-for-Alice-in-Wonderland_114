version notes:

Carroll, Lewis: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (Illus.) v2 11 Dec 2012
I don't think "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" needs any presentation, but anyway, it's a humoristic nonsense story for children of all ages, written by Lewis Carroll (pseudonym of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) and published in 1865. In this book Alice meets the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, the Cheshire Cat, and the Queen of Hearts. This version is illustrated with all the original 42 drawings by John Tenniel.

The text is proofread, and formatted with curly quotes and dashes. I hope the "mouse tail" in Chapter 3 displays fine in most readers. There is some code for non-rectangular wrapping around pictures, but it's commented out, because I'm not entirely satisfied with how it works in all cases (e.g., in landscape orientation).

Don't miss the sequel: Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There.

Any kind of feedback is welcome.

EDIT (v2): Added the Christmas-greetings, fixed a typo and a couple of indents.
