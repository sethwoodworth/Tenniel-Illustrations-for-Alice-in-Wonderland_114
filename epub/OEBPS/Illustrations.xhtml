<a href="Chapter-01.xhtml#ill3">And behind the curtain it was a little door</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-01.xhtml#ill4">She found a little bottle with the words &lsquo;DRINK ME&rsquo;</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-02.xhtml#ill5">&lsquo;I&#8217;m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!&rsquo;</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-02.xhtml#ill6">The Rabbit skurried away into the darkness</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-02.xhtml#ill7">She was up to her chin in salt water</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-02.xhtml#ill8">She soon made out that it was only a mouse</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-03.xhtml#ill9">&lsquo;Hand it over here,&rsquo; said the Dodo.</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-03.xhtml#ill10">&lsquo;Mine is a long and a sad tale!&rsquo; said the Mouse</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-04.xhtml#ill11">She put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-04.xhtml#ill12">She suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air</a><br/>

<a href="Chapter-05.xhtml#ill15">&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; said the Caterpillar</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-05.xhtml#ill16">&lsquo;And yet you incessantly stand on your head&rsquo;</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-05.xhtml#ill17">&lsquo;Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door&rsquo;</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-05.xhtml#ill18">&lsquo;Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak&rsquo;</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-05.xhtml#ill19">&lsquo;Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose&rsquo;</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-06.xhtml#ill20">The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-06.xhtml#ill21">The door led right into a large kitchen</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-06.xhtml#ill22">It was neither more nor less than a pig</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-06.xhtml#ill23">She saw the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-06.xhtml#ill24">&lsquo;I thought it would,&rsquo; said the Cat, and vanished again</a><br/>

<a href="Chapter-08.xhtml#ill29">&lsquo;What&#8217;s your name, child?&rsquo;</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-08.xhtml#ill30">The balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes</a><br/>

<a href="Chapter-09.xhtml#ill32">The Duchess was very ugly</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-09.xhtml#ill33">They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-09.xhtml#ill34">&lsquo;Once I was a real Turtle&rsquo;</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-10.xhtml#ill35">So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice</a><br/>

<a href="Chapter-11.xhtml#ill37">Near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-11.xhtml#ill1">The court of justice</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-11.xhtml#ill38">The wretched Hatter shook both his shoes off</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-11.xhtml#ill39">The Hatter hurriedly left the court</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-12.xhtml#ill40">She tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt</a><br/>
