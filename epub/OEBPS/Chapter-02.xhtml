<h1>The Pool of Tears</h1>

<p class="initial"><span class="drop"><span
class="predrop">&lsquo;</span>C</span><span class="first">uriouser</span> and
curiouser!&rsquo; cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment
she quite forgot how to speak good English); &lsquo;now I&#8217;m opening out
like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!&rsquo; (for when she
looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were
getting so far off). &lsquo;Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on
your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I&#8217;m sure <em>I</em>
sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can; &ndash; but I must be
kind to them,&rsquo; thought Alice, &lsquo;or perhaps they wo&#8217;n&#8217;t
walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I&#8217;ll give them a new pair of boots
every Christmas.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill5">
<img src="images/Illustration-05.jpg" alt="&lsquo;I&#8217;m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!&rsquo;" />
</div>

<p>And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. &lsquo;They must
go by the carrier,&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;and how funny it&#8217;ll seem,
sending presents to one&#8217;s own feet! And how odd the directions will
look!</p>

<blockquote>
<div>Alice&#8217;s Right Foot, Esq.
  <div>Hearthrug,
    <div>near the fender,
      <div>(with Alice&#8217;s love).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Oh dear, what nonsense I&#8217;m talking!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now
more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and
hurried off to the garden door.</p>

<p>Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look
through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than
ever: she sat down and began to cry again.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself,&rsquo; said Alice, &lsquo;a great
girl like you,&rsquo; (she might well say this), &lsquo;to go on crying in this
way! Stop this moment, I tell you!&rsquo; But she went on all the same, shedding
gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches
deep and reaching half down the hall.</p>

<p>After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she
hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit
returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a
large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to
himself as he came, &lsquo;Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh!
<em>Wo&#8217;n&#8217;t</em> she be savage if I&#8217;ve kept her waiting!&rsquo;
Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the
Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, &lsquo;If you please,
sir&mdash;&rsquo; The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and
the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill6">
<img src="images/Illustration-06.jpg" alt="The Rabbit skurried away into the darkness" />
</div>

<p>Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept
fanning herself all the time she went on talking: &lsquo;Dear, dear! How queer
everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if
I&#8217;ve been changed in the night? Let me think: <em>was</em> I the same when
I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.
But if I&#8217;m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah,
<em>that&#8217;s</em> the great puzzle!&rsquo; And she began thinking over all
the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could
have been changed for any of them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not Ada,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;for her hair
goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn&#8217;t go in ringlets at all; and
I&#8217;m sure I ca&#8217;n&#8217;t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things,
and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, <em>she&#8217;s</em> she,
and <em>I&#8217;m</em> I, and &ndash; oh dear, how puzzling it all is!
I&#8217;ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times
five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is &ndash;
oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication
Table doesn&#8217;t signify: let&#8217;s try Geography. London is the capital of
Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome &ndash; no,
<em>that&#8217;s</em> all wrong, I&#8217;m certain! I must have been changed for
Mabel! I&#8217;ll try and say &ldquo;<em>How doth the little &ndash;
</em>&rdquo;&rsquo; and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying
lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and
the words did not come the same as they used to do:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&lsquo;How doth the little crocodile</p>
<p class="indented">Improve his shining tail,</p>
<p>And pour the waters of the Nile</p>
<p class="indented">On every golden scale!</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>How cheerfully he seems to grin,</p>
<p class="indented">How neatly spread his claws,</p>
<p>And welcome little fishes in</p>
<p class="indented">With gently smiling jaws!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;m sure those are not the right words,&rsquo; said poor Alice,
and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, &lsquo;I must be Mabel
after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have
next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No,
I&#8217;ve made up my mind about it; if I&#8217;m Mabel, I&#8217;ll stay down
here! It&#8217;ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying
&ldquo;Come up again, dear!&rdquo; I shall only look up and say &ldquo;Who am I
then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I&#8217;ll come
up: if not, I&#8217;ll stay down here till I&#8217;m somebody else&rdquo;
&ndash; but, oh dear!&rsquo; cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, &lsquo;I
do wish they <em>would</em> put their heads down! I am so <em>very</em> tired of
being all alone here!&rsquo;</p>

<p>As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that
she had put on one of the Rabbit&#8217;s little white kid gloves while she was
talking. &lsquo;How <em>can</em> I have done that?&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;I
must be growing small again.&rsquo; She got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about
two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the
cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in
time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That <em>was</em> a narrow escape!&rsquo; said Alice, a good deal
frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in
existence; &lsquo;and now for the garden!&rsquo; and she ran with all speed back
to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little
golden key was lying on the glass table as before, &lsquo;and things are worse
than ever,&rsquo; thought the poor child, &lsquo;for I never was so small as
this before, never! And I declare it&#8217;s too bad, that it is!&rsquo;</p>

<p>As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she
was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen
into the sea, &lsquo;and in that case I can go back by railway,&rsquo; she said
to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the
general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a
number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with
wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.)
However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept
when she was nine feet high.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill7">
<img src="images/Illustration-07.jpg" alt="She was up to her chin in salt water" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;I wish I hadn&#8217;t cried so much!&rsquo; said Alice, as she swam
about, trying to find her way out. &lsquo;I shall be punished for it now, I
suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That <em>will</em> be a queer thing,
to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off,
and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a
walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she
soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Would it be of any use, now,&rsquo; thought Alice, &lsquo;to speak to
this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, there&#8217;s no harm in trying.&rsquo; So she
began: &lsquo;O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of
swimming about here, O Mouse!&rsquo; (Alice thought this must be the right way
of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she
remembered having seen in her brother&#8217;s Latin Grammar, &lsquo;A mouse
&ndash; of a mouse &ndash; to a mouse &ndash; a mouse &ndash; O mouse!&rsquo;)
The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one
of its little eyes, but it said nothing.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps it doesn&#8217;t understand English,&rsquo; thought Alice;
&lsquo;I daresay it&#8217;s a French mouse, come over with William the
Conqueror.&rsquo; (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very
clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: &lsquo;Ou
est ma chatte?&rsquo; which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book.
The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over
with fright. &lsquo;Oh, I beg your pardon!&rsquo; cried Alice hastily, afraid
that she had hurt the poor animal&#8217;s feelings. &lsquo;I quite forgot you
didn&#8217;t like cats.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill8">
<img src="images/Illustration-08.jpg" alt="She soon made out that it was only a mouse" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;Not like cats!&rsquo; cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.
&lsquo;Would <em>you</em> like cats if you were me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, perhaps not,&rsquo; said Alice in a soothing tone:
&lsquo;don&#8217;t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat
Dinah: I think you&#8217;d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She
is such a dear quiet thing,&rsquo; Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam
lazily about in the pool, &lsquo;and she sits purring so nicely by the fire,
licking her paws and washing her face &ndash; and she is such a nice soft thing
to nurse &ndash; and she&#8217;s such a capital one for catching mice &ndash;
oh, I beg your pardon!&rsquo; cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was
bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. &lsquo;We
wo&#8217;n&#8217;t talk about her any more if you&#8217;d rather not.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We indeed!&rsquo; cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end
of his tail. &lsquo;As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always
<em>hated</em> cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don&#8217;t let me hear the name
again!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wo&#8217;n&#8217;t indeed!&rsquo; said Alice, in a great hurry to
change the subject of conversation. &lsquo;Are you &ndash; are you fond &ndash;
of &ndash; of dogs?&rsquo; The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:
&lsquo;There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!
A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And
it&#8217;ll fetch things when you throw them, and it&#8217;ll sit up and beg for
its dinner, and all sorts of things &ndash; I ca&#8217;n&#8217;t remember half
of them &ndash; and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it&#8217;s so
useful, it&#8217;s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and
&ndash; oh dear!&rsquo; cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, &lsquo;I&#8217;m afraid
I&#8217;ve offended it again!&rsquo; For the Mouse was swimming away from her as
hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. So she
called softly after it, &lsquo;Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
wo&#8217;n&#8217;t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don&#8217;t like
them!&rsquo; When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to
her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
trembling voice, &lsquo;Let us get to the shore, and then I&#8217;ll tell you my
history, and you&#8217;ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds
and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an
Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole
party swam to the shore.</p>
